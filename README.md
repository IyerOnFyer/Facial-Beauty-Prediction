# Predicting Attractiveness using Computer Vision

## Traditional Machine Learning Approach   

#### Feature Generation
The features computation part of the pipeline requires the location of facial landmars of the input images. These landmarks can be generated by the [CLM-framework](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/CLM-framework). I have already included the landmarks localized using this framework in the data directory of this repo, and you can directly work with them. 

Example of extracting facial features:

#### Dimensionality Reduction, ML Models, and Evaluation 

```shell
python trainModel -model linear_model -featuredim 20
```

The `-featuredim` argument specifies the number of components chosen by PCA which are how many dimensions to be reduced. 

After PCA, the `-model` argument is used to indicate the traditional machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (`svm`), Random Forests (`rf`), and Gaussian Process Regression (`gpr`). Checkout the source to change hyperparameters and other options. 

Applying Pearson Correlation for result analysis with learner's prediction. For example, figure below shows PC for evaluation of Linear Regression:

## Deep Learning Approach:

Details of the implementation can be found in the paper [`SCUT-FBP: A Benchmark Dataset for Facial Beauty Perception`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02459.pdf), the result of the creation and research on the dataset.
